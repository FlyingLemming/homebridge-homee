# Homebridge-homee

homee platform plugin for homebridge: https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge

## Installation
Follow the instruction in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge) for the homebridge server installation. The plugin is published through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-homee) and should be installed "globally" by typing:

    sudo npm install -g homebridge-homee
    
Alternatively you could use [**homeean**](https://himpler.com/homeean) to install homebridge-homee (including Homebridge) on a Raspberry Pi with a plain vanilla Raspbian installation. homeean is a web based buildtool, which generates an individual buildscript (Bash-Script) for user selected Smart Home Tools to be installed on a Raspberry Pi running on Raspbian. homebridge-homee (including its dependecy Homebridge) is provided as an homeean install option.

## Configuration

        "description": "This is an example configuration file for the homebridge-homee plugin",
        "hint": "Always paste into jsonlint.com validation page before starting your homebridge, saves a lot of frustration",
        "platforms": [
            {
                "platform": "homee",
                "name": "homee",
                "host": "192.168.178.1",
                "user": "your-username",
                "pass": "your-password",
                "groupName": "group-name",
                "safeGuard": true
            }
        ]
    }

## Exclude nodes or homeegrams
This plugin integrates all (known) devices to homebridge by default. You can limit the integration to certain devices by creating a group in homee and adding all the devices you want to use with homebridge. If not explicitly specified, the name of this group defaults to 'Homebridge'. It may be changed using the optional 'groupName' statement. Devices outside this group are ignored.

### Device Limit
Homekit cannot manage more than 100 devices per bridge. If you have together more than 100 devices and homeegrams, you have to filter some of them with a group.

### Safeguard Mode
In certain cases, this plugin may not be able to establish a connection to your homee during startup. This could happen if, for instance, your homee is not running during Homebridge startup or if your local network is down. As Homebridge will continue anyway, this usually results in all homee devices being removed from HomeKit, including all scenes and automation. By setting the optional 'safeGuard' option to true (default: false), you can prevent Homebridge from starting up whenever a connection to your homee cannot be established or when the number of homee devices is zero.
